# My Personal Website

My personal portfolio website and primarily my blog. 

## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Production Setup
Be sure to run `npm run build` to compile source files. 
Then commit files to the GitHub repository. 
Finally run the deployment script `sh deploy.sh`


## watch_static.sh
This script is needed for hot reload to the static content. To run this script
inotify needs to be installed.
