<p>
  When we design a machine learning algorithm the goal is to have the algorithm
  to perform well on unseen inputs. Regularization deals with this, performing
  well on the test set which the algorithm has never seen before, sometimes at
  the cost of the training accuracy. Regularization is the process of putting
  a penalty terms in the cost function to help the model generalize to new
  inputs. Regularization does this by controlling the complexity of the model
  and preventing overfitting. 
</p>

<p>
  Given a cost function \( J(\theta, \textbf{X}, \textbf{y}) \) we can write
  the regularized version as follows. (Remember \( \theta \) notates the
  parameters of the model).
  $$
  \hat{J}(\theta, \textbf{X}, \textbf{y}) = J(\theta, \textbf{X}, \textbf{y}) +
  \alpha \Omega(\theta)
  $$

  The \( \Omega \) term is the parameter norm penalty and operates on the
  parameters of the network. The constant \( \alpha \in [0, \infty) \) controls
  the effect of the regularization on the cost function. This is a
  hyperparameter that must be tuned. Also another note, when we refer to the
  parameters of the model in regularization we typically only refer to the
  weights of the network not the biases.
</p>

<h3>\(L^2\) Parameter Regularization</h3>

<p>
  This type of regularization defines the parameter norm penalty as the
  following. 
  $$
  \Omega(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \lVert \textbf{w} \rVert _2^2
  $$
  and the total objective function:
  $$
  \hat{J}(\theta, \textbf{X}, \textbf{y}) = J(\theta, \textbf{X}, \textbf{y}) +
  \frac{\alpha}{2} \textbf{w}^T \textbf{w}
  $$

  Evidently this regularization will penalize larger weights. In theory this
  should help prevent the model from overfitting. It is common to employ \( L^2
  \) regularization when the number of observations is less than the number of
  features. Similarily to \( L^2 \) regularization is \( L^1 \) which you can
  probably expect is just \( \Omega(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \lVert \textbf{w}
  \rVert _1 \). In almost all cases \( L^2 \) regularization outperforms \( L^1
  \) regularization.
</p>

<h3>Early Stopping</h3>

<p>
  Take a look at the below graph showing validation loss versus training loss.
  It should be clear that at a certain point the model overfits on the training
  data and begins to suffer in validation accuracy despite this not being
  reflected in the training.

<p>
  The solution to this is to simply stop training once the validation set loss
  has not improved for some time. Just like \( L^1 \) and \( L^2 \)
  regularization this is a method of decreasing overfitting on the training
  dataset. 
</p>

<h3>Ensemble Methods</h3>
<p>
  <i>Bagging</i> (short for bootstrap aggregation, a term in statistics) is the
  technique of making a model generalize better by combining multiple weaker
  learners into a stronger learner. Using this technique, several models are
  trained seperately and their results are averaged for the final result. This
  ideal of one model being composed of several independent models is called an
  ensemble method. Ensemble methods are a great way to fine tune your model to
  make it generalize better on test data. Ensemble methods apply to more than
  just neural networks and can be used on any machine learning technique.
  Almost all machine learning competitions are won using ensemble methods.
  Often times these ensembles can be comprised of dozens and dozens of
  learners. 
</p>

<p>
  The idea is that if each model is trained independently of each other they
  will have their own errors on the test set. However, when the results of the
  ensemble learners are averaged the error should approach zero. 
</p>

<p>
  Using bagging we can even train a multiple models on the same dataset but be
  sure that the models were trained independently. With bagging \( k \)
  different datasets of the same size are constructed from the original dataset
  for \( k \) learners. Each dataset is constructed by sampling from the
  original dataset with some probability with replacement. So there will be
  duplicate and missing values in the constructed dataset. 
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, differences in model initialization and hyperparameter tuning
  can make ensembles of neural networks particularly favorable. 
</p>

<h3>Dropout</h3>

<p>
  Dropout is a very useful form of regularization when used on deep neural
  networks. At a high level dropout can be thought of randomly removing neurons
  from some layer of the network with a probability \( p \). Removing certain
  neurons helps prevent the network from overfitting.
</p>

<p>
  In reality dropout is a form of ensemble learning. Dropout trains an ensemble
  of networks where various neurons have been removed and then averages the
  results, just as before. Below is an image that may help visualize what
  dropout does to a network.
</p>

<p>
  Dropout can be applied to input units and hidden units. The hyperparameter of
  dropout at a given layer is the probability with which a neuron is dropped.
  Furthermore, another major benifit of dropout is that the computational cost
  of using it is relatively low. Finding the correct probability will require
  parameter tuning because a probability too low and dropout will have no
  effect, while too high and the network will be unable to learn anything.
