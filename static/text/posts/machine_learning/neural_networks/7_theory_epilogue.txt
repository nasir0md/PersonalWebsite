  These past sections have covered a lot of material. It will take a while to
  have a true understanding of this content. However, the best way is through
  practice. Hopefully after all that you learned you will be able to properly
  use modern neural network libraries such as Tensorflow, Theano or Keras.

  While standard feedforward networks themselves are important building blocks they are
  not often used in practice. Other statistical learning machines are typically
  used instead. The true power of neural networks comes with the flexibility of
  neural networks when they form more complex networks. 
  You now have the theoretical basis to proceed onto more
  complex and powerful networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks or
  Recurrent Neural Networks which are at the forefront of machine learning
  research.

  If you want a more in depth treatment of neural
  networks I would highly recommend <a
  href='http://hagan.okstate.edu/NNDesign.pdf'>Neural Network Design by
  Hagan</a> (albiet the book is a little bit outdated but I thought the level
  and speed of math in the book was perfect for me). Or there is also <a
  href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618'>Deep
  learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville</a> which is a modern approach
  to deep learning although I thought the math could get a little bit difficult
  and too theoretical at times.
