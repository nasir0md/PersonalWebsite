		<p>
      I am a versatile and motivated software engineer well versed with full
      stack solutions and applications of machine learning. I am most
      passionate about data science and related fields. I am a fast and
      motivated learner.

      I currently study Computer Science and Mathematics at USC, however,
      pursue the majority of my interest outside of the class through
      independent projects, study, and work experience.
