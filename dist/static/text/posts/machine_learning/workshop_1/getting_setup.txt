META: How to setup a machine learning environment.

<p>
These steps describe the necessary software to install for the first
machine learning workshop. Please even if you are certain you have the software
already configured for a certain step still read through <b>all</b> of the
steps.
</p>
<p>
    For whatever reason setting up a ML development environment is a total
pain. <b>Especially</b> if you are using Windows.
</p>
<p>
    A quick note about system specifications. I am assuming that you are
    running a 64 bit operating system. If not download the 32 bit versions of
    programs accordingly. Furthermore, having a decently fast computer will be
    vital when doing large amounts of data processing. Another big aspect of
    working with large datasets is RAM. I would recommend at least 8GB of RAM. 
</p>
<p>
    I would also recommend <b>not</b> installing all this software in the VM used by the CS
    classes. This may change C++ compiler options and I would not want for that
    to mess up system settings on the VM. 
</p>
<p>
    A general note for throughout these tutorials is that <code>$ command
    here</code> designates a command to be entered in the terminal or command
    prompt. 
</p>

<h3>Install Anaconda</h3>
<p>
Anaconda is a data science platform for python that will install a large
majority of the software needed for ML. Anaconda will also install Python so
there is no need to worry about installing that as well.
</p>

<h4>Everything But Windows</h4>
<p>
    Go to the Anaconda installation site at <a
    href='https://www.continuum.io/downloads'>https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a>
    and download the <b>Python 2.7 version with the command line installer</b>.
    Be sure to download the installer for the appropriate operating system (OSX
    or Linux). 
</p>
<p>
    The installation instructions for Anaconda should just be on the downloads
    page. For OSX and Linux <code>cd</code> into the directory containing the installer
    program and run the following for OSX.
<pre>
<code class='language-bash'>
$ bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh 
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Or the following for Linux.
</p>
<pre>
<code class='language-bash'>
$ bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh 
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    To check that Anaconda is installed run the command <code>conda --v</code>.
    If you are OSX and you get the error `command not found: conda` see <a
    href='#tsconda'>the trouble shooting section on exporting the conda path on
    OSX</a> for more info.
</p>


<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>
    Before installing Anaconda you must install TDM GCC x64. Go to the
    downloads page <a href='http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download'>here</a>.
    <b>Download and install the 64 bit version of TDM the installer name is
    tdm64-gcc-5.1.0-2.exe</b>
</p>
<p>
    Run the following commands in the command prompt. 
</p>
<pre>
<code class='language-bash'>
$ conda update conda
$ conda update --all
$ conda install mingw libpython
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Check that everything is working</h4>
<p>
To check that all the proper commands are configured run the following commands
in the command prompt or terminal. We are using the <code>python</code> command
to run our programs and the <code>pip</code> command to install further python
packages.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
$ python -V
$ pip -V
</code>
</pre>

<p>
If your python version has a 2.7 somewhere in there and the pip version
displays then you are all set!
</p>
<p>
    If it says command not found for python go to the <a
    href='#tspython'>section on trouble shooting the python installation</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If the output for the python version does not have 2.7 you have the wrong
    version installed. This will require uninstalling python and reinstalling
    it. See the <a href='#tspythonv'>section on trouble shooting the wrong
    python installation</a> for more information. 
</p>
<p>
    If it outputs the command for
    pip is not found then your computer is missing the pip command see <a
    href='#tspip'>the trouble shooting section for pip</a> for more
    information.
</p>

<h3>Setting up the conda Environment</h3>
<p>
    To keep all of the dependencies in one place we will create a conda
    environment. A conda environment will keep all of the python packages for
    our python projects seperate from the rest of our computer. 
</p>
<p>
    Create a conda environment named 'mlworkshop' that uses python 2.7.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
conda create -n mlworkshop python=2.7
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    If you get something like the error `PackageNotFoundError: Package not
    found` -python=2.7` then run the following.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
conda create -n mlworkshop python
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Now the environment is creating but it is not activated yet. To activate
    the environment on Linux/OSX run <code>source activate mlworkshop</code>.
    To activate the environment on Windows run <code>activate
    mlworkshop</code>.
</p>
<p>
    To leave the environment run <code>source deactivate</code> for Linux/OSX
    and <code>deactivate</code> for Windows.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
    Be sure to be in your mlworkshop conda environment for anything you do
    for this workshop. That includes installing the rest of the software.
    </b>
</p>

<h3>Installing Theano</h3>
<p>
Configured with the proper data science tools that Anaconda provides we are
ready to install Theano. Theano is a python package designed to evaluate and
manipulate complex mathematical expressions involving  high dimensional arrays.
</p>
<p>
What does this have to do with ML? Artificial Neural networks (ANN) are a large part of ML
and the core concept of ANNs are manipulating high dimensional data. Using
Theano we are able to easily create ANNs that perform much more efficiently
than manually writing any mathematical logic ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    You might have heard of Google's TensorFlow before. TensorFlow is a python
    package much like Theano. At this point you may see why TensorFlow is
    called TensorFlow, because it handles the <i>flow</i> (through mathematical
    expressions) of <i>tensors</i> (high dimensional data). While TensorFlow is
    certainly a more popular python library used for Neural Networks and in my
    opinion a lot better and more supported by the community we are using
    Theano because of ease of install for Windows users.
</p>
<p>
    However, as you will see shortly we will use Keras on top of Theano which
    abstracts having to create ANNs. Keras also works with using TensorFlow. So
    if you really wanted to you could install TensorFlow here instead of
    Theano.
</p>
<p>
    If we are so concerned with efficiency why are we doing ML in Python, a high level
    programming language? Wouldn't C++ be faster? 
</p>
<p>
    Well certainly for some operations C++ will be faster but Theano and
    similar packages don't actually evaluate the code in Python. Instead the
    tensor operations are converted to super efficient BLAS or CUDA code. BLAS
    is for effecient numerical processing on the CPU. This should have been
    installed with Anaconda. CUDA code is for efficient numerical processing on
    the GPU. ML is highly parallel so for many tasks <b>massive
    performance</b> boosts can result from using a GPU. Unfortunately
    configuring CUDA with the GPU can be very difficult and as many of our
    laptops will not have dedicated GPUs we will not bother with this.
    (However, for those of you that are interested you can see <a
    href='/blog/machine_learning/configuring_theano_on_ubuntu_with_gpu'>this
    post I made</a> for instructions on how to do so). Some ML models can take
    <b>days</b> to train on a GPU. Running the same on a CPU would be
    infeasible.
</p>
<p>
    To install the Theano python package simply run the following command.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ pip install Theano
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    If this does not work give it a try with <code>sudo</code>.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ sudo pip install Theano
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Before we continue a quick note...</h3>
<p>
    A quick note about text editors and running python scripts. Regardless of
    what text editor you use you should run the python script from the terminal
    or command prompt. For instance if you are using PyCharm do not run python
    in the PyCharm IDE. To run a python program simply enter <code>python
    test.py</code> where <code>test.py</code> would the name of the script you
    are trying to run.
</p>

<h3>Give it a try!</h3>
<p>
    We are now going to test our Thenao installation and the installation of
    numpy, another <b>vital</b> python library. numpy was installed by
    Anaconda. Let's create the function z=x+y and evalute it at the point
    (2,3). Open up a new python file a enter the following. Do not worry if you
    don't understand it. This is just to show generally what Theano does. 
</p>
<pre>
<code class='language-python'>
import numpy
import theano.tensor as T
from theano import function
x = T.dscalar('x')
y = T.dscalar('y')
z = x + y
f = function([x, y], z)

print f(2,3)
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    This script should output 5. If the script fails giving you an import error
    something was not installed correctly. 
</p>

<h3>Installing Keras</h3>
<p>
    We want something easier to use than Theano for creating ANNs. A lot of
    duplicate code is used when creating ANNs with Theano. Keras abstracts all
    of the math that goes into ANNs to make them easy and intuitive to use.
</p>
<p>
    Run the following command to install Keras.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ pip install keras
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    If this does not work give it a try with <code>sudo</code>
</p>

<pre>
<code>
$ sudo pip install keras
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    We aren't ready to start creating ANNs yet though. By default Keras uses
    TensorFlow as its backend tensor manipulation library. We need to switch to
    using Theano as the backend. 
</p>
<p>
    You will be able to find your keras configuration file at your home
    directory <code>~/.keras/keras.json</code> <code>cd</code> to the file
    location. If the <code>.keras</code> directory is not there create it
    <code>mkdir .keras</code> <b>notice the '.' character!</b> If the file
    keras.json is not there create it. Open the file in the editor if your
    choice note that can be done through <code>vim keras.json</code> but
    instead of vim the text editor you want to use. <b>Do not use notepad or
    TextEdit</b> these will incorrectly format the qoutations and give you a
    complicated and hard to solve error when you try to run keras.
</p>
<p>
    Enter <b>only</b> the following text in the file.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
{
    "image_dim_ordering": "th",
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "floatx": "float32",
    "backend": "theano"
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    We are now finally ready to create a ANN using Keras. Create a new python
    script and enter the following. 
</p>
<pre>
<code class='language-python'>
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(output_dim=64, input_dim=100))
model.add(Activation("relu"))
model.add(Dense(output_dim=10))
model.add(Activation("softmax"))
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    After running this hopefully you don't get any errors. Note that nothing
    should be output from this script. If everything ran successfully congrats,
    you just created your first ANN. In the workshop we will actually do
    something with this ANN and train it to make predictions. 
</p>

<h3>Install Misc</h3>
<p>
    We aren't quite done yet. While we have everything that we need for the
    core ML operations we need a couple more python packages for data
    retrieval and visualization. As always if any of these commands fails try
    <code>sudo</code> and then the command. 
</p>
<p>
    Install Pillow an easy to use image loading library. 
</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ pip install Pillow
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Or if that does not work try the following.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ easy_install Pillow
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Next we are going to install the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) for
    python. This will help us deep learning in text applications.
</p>
<p>
    To install NLTK run the following.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
$ pip install nltk
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    NLTK also has a bunch of text data associated with it that we will be using
    in samples. Download this text data by running the following python script.
</p>
<pre>
<code class='language-python'>
import nltk
nltk.download()
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    You should be presented with a download dialog be sure to download
    everything.
</p>
<p>
    Install matplotlib for data visualizations. 
</p>

<pre>
<code>
pip install matplotlib
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Install scikit-learn for further ML functionality.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
pip install scikit-learn
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Final Test</h3>
<p>
    Great at this point you have installed everything that you need to install!
    As a final step verify that everything was installed by running the
    following python commands either in a script or in the python interpreter. 
</p>
<pre>
<code class='language-python'>
from nltk.corpus import brown
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from keras import backend as K


print 'Here are a bunch of words'
print brown.words()
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    A bunch of words should print out to the console. This confirms that the
    corpus data of NLTK was installed correctly. If you can run that without
    error you are set for the workshop this Thursday!

    <h3>Trouble Shooting Python Not Found</h3>
    <p>
        It appears as though your system is not properly recognizing the python
        command. This could be because python was not installed correctly or
        that the environment path is not set correctly. If this happens I would
        recommend honestly just recommend googling your operating system and
        command python not found. If you continue to have problems post a
        message in the Facebook event.
