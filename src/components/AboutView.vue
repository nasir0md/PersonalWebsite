    <h2 class="major">About</h2>
		<p>
      I am a versatile and motivated software engineer well versed with full
      stack solutions and applications of machine learning. I am most
      passionate about data science and related fields. I am a fast and
      motivated learner. I believe the list of technologies I have experience
      with can testify to this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have extensive
      experience developing backend web platforms using modern frameworks and
      building frontend applications for web and mobile. I also have a passion
      for applications of machine learning and data science and continue to
      further learn in the field through implementation and study.  
    </p>

      I currently study CS at USC, however, pursue the majority of my interest
      outside of the class through independent projects, study, and work
      experience.
