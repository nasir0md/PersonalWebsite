  When one writes a computer program they break their problem into multiple
  steps and define procedural steps in their code for the computer to
  execute. The beauty of machine learning is the programmer does not tell the
  computer how to solve the problem. Instead, the computer learns how to solve
  the problem from <b>data</b>.

  If you have heard of machine learning before, chances are you have heard of
  neural networks as well. Neural networks are often called <b>artificial
  neural networks</b> because their structure is loosely modeled off of the
  neuron structure in the brain. The human brain contains around 100 billion
  neurons. Each neuron is a small cell that transmits signals. The neurons are
  connected to each other through dendrites. These small
  neuron units and their connections give humans the
  capability to think.

<p>
  A similar approach was taken to the learning machines that are called
  artificial neural networks. In an artificial neural network many units that
  are also called neurons function together to give the system the capability
  to learn. Like, the brain these neurons are connected to each other. The
  exact structure of neural networks and how these connections and neurons work
  will be discussed in the following pages.

  So why are neural networks so popular? Chances are you have heard of a neural
  network but have no idea what gradient boosting or state vector machines are
  despite the fact that they are all machine learning algorithms that learn
  from data. In recent years, neural networks have exploded in popularity.
  Cheaper and more powerful hardware allowed thousands and then millions of
  neurons in artificial neural networks. This renaissance in machine learning has allowed countless
  breakthroughs in neural networks and their applications. The second reason is
  the versatility of neural networks. Neural networks have found applications
  in text, speech, images and much more. They are a useful machine learning
  tool in a variety of situations.

<p>
  There is a good amount of math associated with neural networks. This post
  will go into much of the surface level theory that goes into a neural
  network. From this theory you should have a good understanding of how basic
  neural networks work and can dive into actual implementation.
