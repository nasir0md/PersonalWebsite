    Machine learning is no longer a subject that only a expert with a Ph.D.
    can understand. Machine learning is becoming increasingly relevant in 
    day to day technology and with this widespread use the accessibility of
    incorperating machine learning in your own projects is becoming
    increasingly easier. It does not take an expert that has years of formal
    schooling to understand and master machine learning. With a decent
    background in mathematics and computer science anybody can learn the
    material and be ready to apply machine learning to their own projects.

    This post will be dedicated to a series of tutorials to teach an audience
    unfamiliar with machine learning the basics of the topic. As this cannot
    possibly be as comprehensive as a book or course the information will be
    presented very briefly and move quickly. 
</p>

<p>
    While the ultimate goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate that machine
    learning is easy to implement using modern frameworks there will also be
    theory discussion sprinkled throughout. The theory of machine learning is
    certainly sometimes difficult to wrap your head around and can be
    frustratingly difficult to learn. Despite this difficulty I believe that it
    is necessary to have a somewhat functional understanding of the theory of
    machine learning algorithms to make the proper choices in implementing
    machine learning solutions. Certainly it might make sense to copy and paste
    code from a website for your own purposes but when your machine learning
    algorithm is not performing as you expected it will be impossible to fix
    without a deeper understanding of the theory. Therefore, I believe it is
    crucial to have knowledge of the theory behind machine learning for
    implementation.

<p>
    I understand that much of the theory may be intimidating. It will take
    perseverance to try to make it through the math to obtain a deeper
    understanding of how the algorithms work. 
</p>
<p>
    However, after this tutorial you should have a solid understanding of
    machine learning and how to use it in your own projects.
