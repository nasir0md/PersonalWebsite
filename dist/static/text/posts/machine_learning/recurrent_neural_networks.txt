  I was going to write a tutorial for recurrent neural networks as part of the
  neural networks tutorials that I was doing. However, instead I ended up
  working on the curriculum post that can be found on the website of CAIS++ for
  recurrent neural networks (RNNs). I think the blog post on the CAIS++ website
  does a great job of explaining it so no point in copying myself here.

  Note that on the website of CAIS++ you will find similar material on neural
  networks that you will find here because I used a lot of the content that was
  originally here on my blog for the curriculum there.
