  In the example on the last page we relied on using the mean squared error for
  our <i>cost function</i>. This cost function is what we minimized through stochiastic
  gradient descent (SGD) and tells how good the model is doing given the
  parameters.
</p>

<p>
  However, the mean squared error may not always be the best cost function. In
  fact a more popular loss function is the <i>cross entropy cost function.</i>
  However, before we get more into the cross-entropy cost function let's look
  into the <i>softmax classification function</i>.
</p>

<h3>Softmax Classifier</h3>

<p>
  Let's say you are building a neural network to classify between two classes.
  Our neural network will look something like the following image. Notice
  that there are two outputs \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) representing class one and
  two respectively. 
</p>

<p>
  We are given a set of data points \( \textbf{X} \) and their corresponding
  labels \( \textbf{Y} \). How might we represent the labels? A given point is
  either class one or class two. The boundry is distinct. If you remember the
  linear classification boundry from earlier we said that any output greater
  than 0 was class one and any output less than 0 was class two. However, that
  does not really work here. A given data point \( \textbf{x}_i \) is simply
  class one or class two. We should not have data points be more class one than
  other data points. 
</p>

<p>
  We will use <i>one hot encoding</i> to provide labels for these points. If a
  data point has the label of class one simply assign it the label vector \(
  \textbf{y}_i = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix} \) and for a data point of class two assign it the label vector
  \( \textbf{y}_i = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
  \end{bmatrix} \)
</p>

<p>
  Say our network outputs the value \( \begin{bmatrix}
    c_1 \\
    c_2
  \end{bmatrix} \) where \(c_1, c_2 \) are just constants. We can say the
  network classified the input as class one if \( c_1 > c_2 \) or classified as
  class two if \( c_2 > c_1 \). Let's use the softmax function to interpret
  these results in a more probablistic manner.
</p>

<p>
  The softmax function is defined as the following 
  $$
    q(\textbf{c}) = \frac{e^{c_i}}{\sum_j e^{c_j}} 
  $$

  Where \( c_i \) is the scalar output of the \(ith\) element of the output
  vector. Think of the numerator as converting the output to an unnormalized
  probablity. Think of the denominator as normalizing the probability. This
  means that for every output \( i \) the loss function will have an output
  between 0 and 1. Furthermore, the sum of each output \( i \) will sum to one
  just as with any probability distribution.
</p>

<h3>Entropy</h3>

<p>
  We need to take one more step to use the softmax function as a loss function. This
  requires some knowledge of what entropy is. Think about this example. Say you
  were having a meal at EVK, one of the USC dining halls. If your meal is bad
  this event does not carry much information as the meals are almost garunteed
  to be bad at EVK. However, if the meal is good this event carries a lot of
  information as it is out of the ordinary. You would not tell anyone about the bad meal
  because that is expected, but you would tell everyone about the good meal.
  Entropy deals with the measure of information. If we know an underlying 
  distribution \( y \) to some
  system we can define how much information is encoded in each event. We can
  write this mathematically as:
  $$
    H(y) = \sum_i y_i \log \left( \frac{1}{y_i} \right) = - \sum_i y_i \log (
    y_i )
  $$
</p>

<h3>Cross Entropy</h3>

<p>
  This definition assumes that we are operating under the correct underlying
  probability distribution. Let's say a new student at USC has no idea what the
  dining hall food is like and thinks EVK normally serves great food. This
  freshman has not been around long enough to know the true probability
  distribution of EVK food and instead assumes the probability
  distribution \( y'_i \). Now this freshman incorrectly
  thinks that bad meals are uncommon. If the freshman were to tell a 
  sophomore (who knows the real distribution) that his meal at EVK was
  bad this information would mean little to the sophomore because the
  sophomore already knows that EVK food is almost always bad. We can say that the cross
  entropy is the encoding of events in \( y \) using the wrong probability
  distribution \( y' \). This gives 
  $$
  H(y, y') = - \sum_i y_i \log y'_i
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Now let's go back to our neural network classification problem. We know the
  true probability distribution for any sample should be just the one hot
  encoded label of the sample. We also know that our generated probability
  distribution is the softmax function. This gives the final form of our cross
  entropy loss.
  $$
  L_i = -\log \left( \frac{e^{c_i}}{\sum_j e^{c_j}} \right)
  $$
  Where \( y_i = 1 \) for the correct label and \( y' \) is the softmax
  function.
  This loss function is often called the categorical cross entropy loss
  function because it works with categorical data (i.e. data that can be
  classified into distinct classes).
</p>

<p>
  And while I will not go over it here know that this function has calculable
  derivatives as well. This allows it to be used just the same as the mean
  squared error loss function in the previous example. However, the cross
  entropy loss function has many desirable properties that the mean squared
  error does not have when it comes to classification. 
</p>

<p>
  Let's say you are trying to predict the classes cat or dog. Your neural
  network has a softmax function on the output layer (as it should because this
  is a classification problem). Let's say for two inputs \(
  \textbf{x}_1,\textbf{x}_2 \) the network respectively outputs
  $$ 
  \textbf{a}_1 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.55 \\
    0.45
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{a}_2 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.44 \\
    0.56
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  where the corresponding labels are
  $$
  \textbf{y}_1 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{y}_2 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  As you can see the network only barely classified each result as correct. But
  by only looking at the classification error the accuracy would have been
  100%. 
</p>

<p>
  Take a similar example where the output of the network is just slightly off.
  $$ 
  \textbf{a}_1 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.51 \\
    0.49
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{a}_2 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.41 \\
    0.59
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{y}_1 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{y}_2 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  Now in this case we would have a 0% classification accuracy.
</p>
  
<p>
  Let's see what our cross entropy function would have given us in each
  situation when averaged across the two samples.

  In the first situation:
  $$
  -(\log(0.55) + \log(0.56)) / 2 = 0.59
  $$

  In the second situation: 
  $$
  -(\log(0.49) + \log(0.59)) / 2 = 0.62
  $$

  Clearly this result makes a lot more sense for our situation.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, the choice of the correct loss function is dependent on the problem and is a
  decision you must make in designing your neural network. However, always keep
  in mind the general form for stochastic gradient descent will have the form 
  $$
  \mathbf{W} (k) = \textbf{W}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x}_k, \textbf{W}(k-1))
  $$
  $$
  \mathbf{b} (k) = \textbf{b}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x}_k, \textbf{b}(k-1))
  $$
  Where \( J \) is the loss function.
