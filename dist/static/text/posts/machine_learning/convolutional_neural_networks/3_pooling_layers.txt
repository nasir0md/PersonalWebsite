  The roll of pooling layers is to reduce the dimensionality of the input. 
  Pooling layers are typically put right after convolution layers. Reducing the
  dimensionality of the input both reduces the number of parameters and
  therefore the comlexity of the network and in turns reduces overfitting.

<p>
  The pooling layer operates over every depth slice and does nothing to change
  the depth of the input. However, the output height and width are reduced
  through sampling areas of the image. 
</p>

<p>
  The most common type of pooling is max pooling. Max pooling takes only the
  maximum pixel value from a region of pixels. So for instance for a max
  pooling with filter size 2x2 with a stride of 2 would reduce a 8x8 image to a
  2x2 image. In the image below each color of the image is a region that the
  pooling considers independently of the other regions.

<p>
  More generally, pooling can be viewed as a type of downsampling. For max pooling
  backpropagation just has to know which pixel from each region had the highest
  value in the forward pass so that the gradient is only routed through that
  pixel. However, besides that everything else remains the same.

<p>
  And with that we have all the building blocks to a convolutional neural
  network!
