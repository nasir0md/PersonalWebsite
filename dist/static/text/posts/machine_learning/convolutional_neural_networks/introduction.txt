  Before reading this lesson I would highly recommend first checking out the
  lesson on <a href='/blog/machine_learning/neural_networks/introduction'>regular neural networks</a>. The topics in this lesson will build off
  of that lesson. 
</p>
<p>
  At this point we have learned how artificial neural networks can take in
  some numerical features as input, feed this input through a variety of
  transformations involving weights, biases and activation functions, and
  output a meaningful final result. We also learned how these neural networks
  can, given a number of training examples, gradually teach themselves to
  produce more accurate outputs, allowing them to optimize their performance
  without having to be manually programmed.
</p>

<p>
  In learning all this, we laid down the building blocks for almost all of
  modern deep learning. Turns out, the flexibility of these artificial neural
  networks allows us to develop even more sophisticated models specialized for
  certain tasks, often with much higher levels of performance and scalability.
  In this lesson, weâ€™ll introduce one such specialized neural network created
  mainly for the task of image processing: the convolutional neural network.

  Convolutional neural networks <b>(abbreviated as CNNs or ConvNets)</b> are one of the the driving
  factors behind the deep learning learning movement today. CNNs have been
  proven to be <b>vastly</b> superior to traditional approaches in the realm of
  images and other spatial data. The next several lessons will lay the
  theoritical framework for the motivation and implementation of CNNs and how
  they power much of the modern deep learning frenzy.
