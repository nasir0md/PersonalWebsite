    Note that only a high level understanding of these concepts are necessary to
    continue. This page will try to give a high level understanding of how
    neural networks (NNs) work. 
</p>
<p>
    For now let's just accept that NNs are a very useful computational model
    and try to develop some of the theory behind NNs. Our brain is composed of
    many neurons recieving stimuli and firing. Collectively this makes up our
    consciousness. Neurons 'fire' and release an electrical signal when the
    incoming electrical signal is greater than a certain threshold. Let's use
    this biological description of a neuron to develop our theory of artificial
    neurons.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the mathematical description of the neuron displayed in the below
    picture.

    Let's go over the components of this neuron.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(w\) is <b>weight</b> (just some number)</li>
    <li>\(p\) is <b>input</b> (just some number)</li>
    <li>\( b \) is <b>bias</b> (just some number)</li>
    <li>\( \Sigma \) is the <b>summer</b> (this is just the operation of
    addition you will see more about this shortly)</li>
    <li>\( n \) is the output of the summer (just some number)</li>
    <li>\[ f \) is the activation function (just some function)</li>
</ul>
